# BuilderGenerator

Public version of CodeAPI BuilderGen.

BuilderGenerator generates the builder based on the source-code (CodeAPI BuilderGen generates builder based on class-file).

BuilderGenerator can only generate Java builders but supports all languages that generate `Java Annotation Processing stubs`.

**Classes generated by BuilderGenerator does not requires runtime-dependency**

# Builder

BuilderGenerator is designed to generate Builders for immutable objects, base classes must contains an inner class `Builder<T, B extends Builder<T, B>>`, also we recommend you to have a `Builder<BASE_CLASS, ?> builder()` method.

## Base classes

Base class provide a set of methods to `get` properties and a `Builder` class to provide builder methods for class properties and optionally specify properties specification.

Example of valid base class:

```java
interface Person {
    String getName();
    int getAge();
    
    Builder<Person, ?> builder();
    
    interface Builder<T extends Person, B extends Builder<T, B>> extends com.myproject.BaseBuilder<T, B> {
        
        Builder<T, B> withName(String name);
        Builder<T, B> withAge(int age);
        
        String getName();
        String getAge();
    }
}
```

A base `Builder` class is recommended to provide a `build()` method, BuilderGenerator provides a `Builder` class, but it is not recommended to extend this class.

Example of `BaseBuilder`:

```java
interface BaseBuilder<T, B extends BaseBuilder<T, B>> {
    T build();   
}
```

## Implementation class

Implementation class is a concrete class that implements the base class.

# Notes

- BuilderGenerator does not require a base `Builder<T, B extends Builder<T, B>>` class, but it is recommended to provide a `build()` method.
- BuilderGenerator automatically generate null checks for non-null `Object` properties
